# ðŸŸ¢ Jarvis Daily Commit Dashboard

> Automatically updated every day by a GitHub Action

| ðŸ“… Date (UTC)       | âœ… Status       |

**How it works**

- A scheduled GitHub Action runs daily (cron: `0 0 * * *` UTC).
- It updates `last-updated.txt` with current UTC date/time.
- A commit is pushed, triggering your green square on GitHub.
- This README shows the **latest update time** and a visual contribution graph via [ghchart](https://github.com/ahaager/ghchart).

## ðŸ”§ Setup Checklist

1. Action exists at `.github/workflows/daily.yml`
2. `last-updated.txt` gets overwritten and committed daily
3. GitHub Actions shows a successful run every day
4. GitHub profile graph reflects these commits

Let me know if you'd like to link additional stats â€” like total commit count, streaks, or even embed automated charts or quotes. I can help add those too.
